                        <p class="project__shortd">FVSO (Fact vs. Opinion) is a web extension in the works that promotes news literacy and critical thinking by quantifying the volume of objective versus subjective language in the media. Our team (a part of Medium Design Collective @ Cornell) worked to design an interface that would encourage this kind of thinking without detracting from the reading experience and without inflecting our own biases. The tool allows the user to view headlines from a range of sources side by side, on a spectrum that ranges from totally objective to totally subjective. The goal here is to showcase the differences in levels of objectivity and subjectivity in the headlines and articles of popular news media sources in a way that gives the reader a full awareness of any potential bias they have when choosing their new source. NLP development is on hold for the time being due to Covid.</p>

In this challenging game, users have to strategically manage a limited amount of resources and population in order to survive and grow their society. Features include building placement, resource conversion, seasonal changes, map generation, mortality rates, an interactive interface, and more. A Javascript port is soon to be in the works!</p>

In this project, we simulated the evolution of aritifical life (critters). The scope of this project included creating an AST parser and interpreter for the given critter language (users can upload critter programs), a simulator for the execution environment, a graphical front end, and a distributed implementation of the system. Users can launch their own server which can then be logged on to by others. Users would then be able to interact with the simulation and do actions such as compete to kill other critter species or try to survive for as long as possible.</p>

Creating this email in Mailchimp took up a few hours each week, so I developed a web app that scraped the messages from the channel to automate creating entries.</p>

The old version of his website (made with Squarespace) was designed in such a way that there was little room for engagement with his content and there were lower user retention rates. I spent a few months coming up with a new UI that addressed these issues and made the visual identity still familiar but more visually appealing. I then implemented the UI as well as an admin interface with the flat-file CMS Grav.</p>
