  short_description: Case Study for Cornell Medium Design Collective.
  long_description: FVSO (Fact vs. Opinion) is a web extension in the works that promotes
    news literacy and critical thinking by quantifying the volume of objective versus
    subjective language in the media. Our team (a part of Medium Design Collective
    @ Cornell) worked to design an interface that would encourage this kind of thinking
    without detracting from the reading experience and without inflecting our own
    biases. The tool allows the user to view headlines from a range of sources side
    by side, on a spectrum that ranges from totally objective to totally subjective.
    The goal here is to showcase the differences in levels of objectivity and subjectivity
    in the headlines and articles of popular news media sources in a way that gives
    the reader a full awareness of any potential bias they have when choosing their
    new source. NLP development is on hold for the time being due to Covid.

  long_description: Camlished was built by my partners Bryan (@raisinrand) and Changyuan
    (@Coreball) and I as our final project for CS 3110. In this challenging game,
    users have to strategically manage a limited amount of resources and population
    in order to survive and grow their society. Features include building placement,
    resource conversion, seasonal changes, map generation, mortality rates, an interactive
    interface, and more. A Javascript port is soon to be in the works!

  short_description: Simulation of turing complete language.
  long_description: Our final project for CS 2112 consisted of four assignments that
    built upon each other. In this project, we simulated the evolution of aritifical
    life (critters). The scope of this project included creating an AST parser and
    interpreter for the given critter language (users can upload critter programs),
    a simulator for the execution environment, a graphical front end, and a distributed
    implementation of the system. Users can launch their own server which can then
    be logged on to by others. Users would then be able to interact with the simulation
    and do actions such as compete to kill other critter species or try to survive
    for as long as possible.

  short_description: Interactive alternative presentation
  long_description: My high school had a senior experience program where we spent
    every Wednesday internship. SE culimated in a final presentation at the end of
    the year and if I wanted to rep CMYK properly, there was no way that I could use
    a powerpoint. Instead, I created an interactive presentation that uses d3 and
    made it visually appealing for me to walk through my content.

  short_description: Web app that scrapes Slack Channel to generate weekly newsletter
  long_description: My former internship CMYK has a weekly newsletter called Fast
    Five. Employees send in outrageous links to one of the slack channels and then
    compete with each other to get the most clicks on the newsletter. Creating this
    email in Mailchimp took up a few hours each week, so I developed a web app that
    scraped the messages from the channel to automate creating entries.

  short_description: Developed a new site for the organization 180° of Impact
  long_description: My capstone project for my senior year in high school was to design
    and develop a new website for the organization 180° of Impact, run by the awesome
    Matt Scott. The old version of his website (made with Squarespace) was designed
    in such a way that there was little room for engagement with his content and there
    were lower user retention rates. I spent a few months coming up with a new UI
    that addressed these issues and made the visual identity still familiar but more
    visually appealing. I then implemented the UI as well as an admin interface with
    the flat-file CMS Grav.

  long_description: Generation Coders is a group that I co-ran that teaches different

    workshops, we wanted to keep track of all out past/future events. I came up with
    the design and then built the website.
