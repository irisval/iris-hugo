  short_description: Audio visualizer built with p5
  long_description: I've been fascinated with Dave Whyte's work for years (@beesandbombs
    on tumblr) and I wanted to create something that could be similarly visually appealing.
    Using p5, I created a music visualizer that users can upload audio to and responds
    to factors such as bass and treble levels.

  short_description: Built a Timer app for the Pomodoro Technique, uses Electron +
    HTML/CSS + Javascript
  long_description: The Pomodoro technique is one that I often use when I'm having
    trouble studying. I had a hard time finding a free timer that I liked so I decided
    to build my own. The electron app keeps track of the 25-/5- minute intervals for
    you and records your cycle history.

    custom blacklisting/whitelisting in addition to options to remove profanity-laden
    comments, remove all comments, or comments with links.

  short_description: Built new website + admin interface for nonprofit Next Gen Creators
    using PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, Grav, Twig
  long_description: Next Gen Creators is a tech initiative in the Caribbean that provides
    a platform for developers and future developers to engage. Elixir Labs stepped
    in to build them their new website and I was the lead developer on that team.
    Over the course of this project, I worked with the designer to implement all of
    the front end and integrated the flat file cms Grav so that the Next Gen Team
    would be able to have full customizability over their content simply through 'plug
    & chug'. This version of the website isn't being used anymore but I've uploaded
    it to Heroku for posterity.

  - AWS
  year: '2017'
  short_description: Built main website + registration portal + internal tools for
    hackathon, uses Flask + HTML/CSS/JS + AWS
  long_description: From its first run back in 2014, hackBCA has always had an attendance
    size of 400~650 people which meant we needed an efficient way for event staff
    to make sure that everything was running smoothly. For hackBCA IV, I built the
    main website in accordance with the specific needs of that year. I built the website,
    including the front end , application portal, and internal tools for the hackathon.
    Note - the AWS hosting got taken down so I've reuploaded the site to a different
    host for posterity.

  short_description: Built dashboard interface that consolidated schoolâ€™s 8 separate
    apps into a single web app & login system, uses PHP
  long_description: At the time, my high school had about 8 separate web apps that
    had their own log in/permissions, url, and identity. Having to keep in mind all
    of the different links was a pain for students and the system was not as extensible
    for student developers. I built a dashboard interface that consolidated all of
    these apps into a single web app & login system that lived under the same path.

    in a family tree, which can be uploaded as a JSON file.
