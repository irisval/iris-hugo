  short_description: Interactive alternative presentation
  long_description: My high school had a senior experience program where we spent
    every Wednesday internship. SE culimated in a final presentation at the end of
    the year and if I wanted to rep CMYK properly, there was no way that I could use
    a powerpoint. Instead, I created an interactive presentation that uses d3 and
    made it visually appealing for me to walk through my content.

  short_description: Audio visualizer built with p5
  long_description: I've been fascinated with Dave Whyte's work for years (@beesandbombs

    Using p5, I created a music visualizer that users can upload audio to and responds
    to factors such as bass and treble levels.

    trouble studying. I had a hard time finding a free timer that I liked so I decided
    to build my own. The electron app keeps track of the 25-/5- minute intervals for
    you and records your cycle history.
