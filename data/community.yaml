  long_description: Medium Design Collective is Cornell's organization dedicated to
    empowering individuals and creating solutions through design. In Fall 2019, Medium
    launched incubate projects, where teams of 3-5 joined together to solve a problem
    through the design process. As a member of the Society incubate, my team has been
    working on web app targeting news literacy. This app will analyze articles for
    users to deliver subjectivity metrics and related content. Our case study will
    be launching in this year's Medium Editorial and we are currently working to finish
    this app by June for Medium's annual RAW Expo.

    main website in accordance with the specific needs of that year. I built the website,
    including the front end , application portal, and internal tools for the hackathon.
